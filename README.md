# Object_Detection_and_Segmentation
Using YoloV3 and Gaussian Average on Image for Masking

This repository is part of my assignment for Perception of Robotics class. 

The assignment entails using Images from kitti dataset with disparity maps and requres us to calculate depth.

Next step involves calculating the bounding boxes for cars using YoloV3 

After the bounding boxes are discovered we create a mask for segmentation of cars from the image.


Future Work: Applying Mask R-CNN on images to find better segmentation of images.
